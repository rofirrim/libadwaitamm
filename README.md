[![C/C++ CI Fedora 37](https://github.com/rofirrim/libadwaitamm/actions/workflows/meson-fedora.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rofirrim/libadwaitamm/actions/workflows/meson-fedora.yml)

## Alternative

Please, consider [Peel](https://gitlab.gnome.org/bugaevc/peel) as a more modern approach to C++ bindings for GObject-based libraries, including Gtk and Adwaita.

## About

`libadwaitamm` is a C++ binding for the [GNOME Adwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/) library.

## How to build

Make sure you fulfill the following dependences:

 - `>=meson-0.56`
 - `>=glibmm-2.73.2`
 - `>=pangomm-2.50.0`
 - `>=gtkmm-4.6.1`
 - `>=libadwaita-1.2.0`
 - `>=mm-common-get-1.0.0`
   - This is only needed when building in maintainer mode which is the default when not building from a tarball.

If you need a reference environment, Fedora 37 has all the required components
already packaged.
